Paper: A problem-solving approach to product design using decision tree induction based on intuitionistic fuzzy
Domain: Product Development

Problem Context:
Customer complaints often reveal gaps between product design specifications and user requirements. During product development, designers must interpret customer feedback to identify shortcomings in product functionality or reliability. However, the symptoms of such problems are typically vague, subjective, and uncertain, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. Because these complaints arise from user observations rather than measurable engineering data, the relationship between perceived symptoms and potential design faults is often ambiguous. Addressing this uncertainty is essential to prevent problem recurrence and to integrate corrective insights into future product design considerations.

Problem Formulation:
Observed symptoms of failure should be categorized to specific design faults, in order to get to know the underying cause of customer complaint.

ML Solution:
- Problem Type: Classification
- Algorithm: DT
- Rationale: Classification is appropriate because the task involves categorizing entities into predefined classes or groups.

Paper: Requirements extraction from engineering standards - systematic evaluation of extraction techniques
Domain: Requirements Engineering

Problem Context:
Engineering design is a knowledge-intensive activity that relies heavily on accessing and managing information embedded in technical documents. Among these, engineering standards play a key role by defining normative requirements for products, processes, and services and by supporting decision-making throughout the product development process. However, current practices for working with standards are inefficient, as engineers must manually identify and transfer relevant content from static document formats such as PDFs into engineering tools. This manual process is time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies, making the systematic and efficient use of standards information a persistent challenge in engineering practice.

Problem Formulation:
Requirements should be identified within standards documents to enable their systematic use in product development.

ML Solution:
- Problem Type: Classification
- Algorithm: BERT, SVM, RF, NB
- Rationale: Classification is appropriate because the task involves categorizing entities into predefined classes or groups.

Paper: A CLUSTERING AND WORD SIMILARITY BASED APPROACH FOR IDENTIFYING PRODUCT FEATURE WORDS
Domain: Product Development

Problem Context:
To evaluate how products perform in the market and how they are perceived by customers, product designers increasingly rely on publicly available customer feedback. Online product reviews on e-commerce platforms represent a rich and authentic source of such information, as consumers voluntarily express their opinions without external prompting. However, analyzing this data poses challenges due to the ambiguity and variability of natural language-different words or phrases may refer to the same product feature, while others may have multiple meanings. Therefore, an essential step in understanding customer feedback is to capture the product features discussed in these reviews in a structured and compact form.

Problem Formulation:
Different terms referring to the same product feature should be grouped together to create a concise and unified representation of product features discussed in online reviews.

ML Solution:
- Problem Type: Clustering
- Algorithm: kmeans
- Rationale: Clustering is applicable because the task involves grouping similar entities based on shared characteristics without predefined labels. The clustering algorithm can identify natural groupings in the data without requiring labeled examples.

Previous studies have mainly focused on identifying general feature categories from this data, such as "camera" or "battery," rather than the detailed components that constitute these features. However, in practical product development, sub-features-such as "front camera," "rear camera," or "battery life"-are crucial for determining component configurations and guiding design improvements.

Problem Formulation:
Semantically similar phrases from online product reviews should be grouped into distinct sets that represent related sub-features of a product.

ML Solution:
- Problem Type: Clustering
- Algorithm: HDBSCAN, spectral clustering
- Rationale: Clustering is applicable because the task involves grouping similar entities based on shared characteristics without predefined labels. The clustering algorithm can identify natural groupings in the data without requiring labeled examples.

Paper: Customer Requirements Mapping Method Based on Association Rule Mining for Mass Customization
Domain: Customer Analysis

Problem Context:
Customer requirements analysis represents a crucial step in product variety design for mass customization, where companies aim to meet diverse individual needs without incurring excessive complexity or cost. Traditional approaches such as Quality Function Deployment (QFD) are widely used to translate the voice of the customer into product characteristics, yet they rely heavily on subjective human judgment during the extraction and weighting of customer requirements. The resulting imprecision and ambiguity often reduce the reliability of requirement interpretation. Furthermore, since most new products evolve from existing product families, the management of product variants and their relationships to customer needs becomes increasingly complex, calling for systematic approaches to establish consistent mappings between customer requirements and product architecture.

Problem Formulation:
Based on the general data structure of a product family (Generic Bill of Materials), relationships must be identified between customer requirements and corresponding elements of the product architecture to enable consistent and reliable mapping of customer needs to product variants.

ML Solution:
- Problem Type: Association Rule
